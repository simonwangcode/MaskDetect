# AI-based Face Mask Detection 
<p>This application uses machine learning to detect the presence of face masks in an image or in real time through video stream. MaskDetect was built with Python and Tensorflow. </p>

# Detecting Face Masks In Images
<p>This machine learning model was fit to a training set of only 14 images taken by my webcam. Despite the limited training set, it is still able to generalize quite well to images of other people.</p>
