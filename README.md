## AI-Based Face Mask Detection 
<p>MaskDetect uses machine learning to detect the presence of face masks in images or in real time through video streams. This application was built with Python and TensorFlow. </p>

## Detecting Face Masks In Images
<p>This machine learning model was fit to a training set of only 14 images (of me) taken by my webcam. Despite limited training examples, it is still able to generalize quite well to images of different dimensions and other people.</p>

## Detecting Face Masks In Real Time Through Video Stream
MaskDetect can also accept video streams as input to detect the presence of face masks in real time.
